Use Test Driven Development (TDD) to design a program to solve Conway's Game of Life.

Rough Steps:
1. Write a new test
2. Run all tests to see if they pass
3. Write code to pass tests
4. Run tests again
5. Refactor Code
6. Repeat

Technologies used:
Jest: it's familiarity to me will be very helpful in writing a battery of tests. I have used Jest before, but never as extensively as with this project.
NodeJS, ESM, OOP, TDD, Data Structures, Algorithms, and many more
