Conway's Game of Life: TDD Style

Use Test Driven Development (TDD) to design a program to solve Conway's Game of Life.

TDD Steps at a glance:
1. Write a new test
2. Run all tests to see if they pass
3. Write code to pass tests
4. Run tests again
5. Refactor Code
6. Repeat

Conway's Game of Life at a glance:
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

Success condition:

This project will be complete when a significant number of tests have been written that satisfy the methodology for TDD. If a successful program for the Game of Life gets written, this will be considered Extra Credit. The main focus of this project is to successfully follow TDD best practices and habits.

Technologies used:

Jest: it's familiarity to me will be very helpful in writing a battery of tests. I have used Jest before, but never as extensively as with this project.
NodeJS, ESM, OOP, TDD, Data Structures, Algorithms, and many more
